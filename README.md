# MathGame
Help kids practice basic arithmetic operations and get good at doing them fast. Being able to quickly add, subtract, multiply and divide gives one a good foundation.

It works, but the GUI needs to be improved (better input validation required to better guide children, and a more intuitive way to set up the game options).
